# Logical hardware groupings

This module provides types for representing logical groups of hardware
components. Groups are used in hardware topology to represent collections
of related components that don't fit into other specific categories.

Groups can represent:

- NUMA distances
- I/O groups
- Logical partitions
- Custom hardware groupings defined by the system
