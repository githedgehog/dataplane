# Cargo automatically runs this script for every unit test (this applies to nextest as well).
# The script has two main responsibilities:
#
# 1. It runs `setcap` on the _test binary_ to elevate the test's _permitted_ capabilities.
#    This action _does not_ cause the tests to run with these capabilities active by default.
#    That would involve setting the _effective_ capabilities for the test binary (which we don't do).
#    Instead, assigning the _permitted_ capabilities allows the use of the `caps` crate to allow us to request elevated
#    permissions for specific sections of test code.
#
#    The purpose of these elevated privileges is to allow the tests to create and destroy virtual network interfaces and
#    network namespaces (as is required for integration testing).
#
# 2. It bind mounts the (setcap modified) test binary, the project directory, and a few other files into a (read-only)
#    docker container (which executes the test).  This docker container contains _only_ libc and libgcc_s (to better
#    simulate our deployment environment and discourage faulty assumptions about what will be available at runtime).
#
#    The purpose of this container is to
#    * minimize the damage a faulty test might do
#    * make sure that we aren't relying on resources only available on the developer's machine in the tests (test like
#      we are in prod).
#
# Hopefully, this process also requires us to carefully think about what parts of our code require which privileges (and
# to document these requirements carefully).  I'm lookin' at you, future me :)

# Notes about this command:
# * Note that we mount everything we can as read-only
# * --ipc=host and --pid=host are to allow debuggers to connect to the tests more easily.
# * We mount $1 in case it is an IDE's helper runner.
#   If not, then no harm has been done as $1 will be mounted by the project_dir mount anyway.
# * We drop all caps and then add back just the caps we know we need.
#   This allows those capabilities into our ambient+inheritable set, letting us elevate to them as needed.
#   Critically, it _does not_ give us these capabilities by default (i.e., they aren't in our effective set) because
#   the above setcap command has enumerated exactly what our defaults should be.
# * If you adjust the list of --cap-add arguments, then you need to adjust the above setcap command as well.
