# Gateway test-env

We need an environment in which we can run integration tests between the [control plane], [dataplane], and [management plane].

This task will require coordination between the [dataplane]'s extant test environment and the [control plane]'s test environment.
Note that there is _**no requirement**_ that the integration tests exist in a single.
In fact, it is likely best that they do not.

## Likely assignment

* Primary: [@Fredi-raspall]
* Coordinate with: [@daniel-noland]
