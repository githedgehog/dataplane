CVE                                                CVSSv3   Description
https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-3198     3.3      A vulnerability has been found in GNU Binutils 2.43/2.44 and classified as problematic. Affected by this vulnerability is the function display_info of the file binutils/bucomm.c of the component objdump. The manipulation leads to memory leak. An attack has to be approached locally. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The patch is named ba6ad3a18cb26b79e0e3b84c39f707535bbc344d. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue.
https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-8224     3.3      A vulnerability has been found in GNU Binutils 2.44 and classified as problematic. This vulnerability affects the function bfd_elf_get_str_section of the file bfd/elf.c of the component BFD Library. The manipulation leads to null pointer dereference. Local access is required to approach this attack. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The name of the patch is db856d41004301b3a56438efd957ef5cabb91530. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue.
https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-8225     3.3      A vulnerability was found in GNU Binutils 2.44 and classified as problematic. This issue affects the function process_debug_info of the file binutils/dwarf.c of the component DWARF Section Handler. The manipulation leads to memory leak. Attacking locally is a requirement. The identifier of the patch is e51fdff7d2e538c0e5accdd65649ac68e6e0ddd4. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue.
https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-1153     3.1      A vulnerability classified as problematic was found in GNU Binutils 2.43/2.44. Affected by this vulnerability is the function bfd_set_format of the file format.c. The manipulation leads to memory corruption. The attack can be launched remotely. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitation appears to be difficult. Upgrading to version 2.45 is able to address this issue. The identifier of the patch is 8d97c1a53f3dc9fd8e1ccdb039b8a33d50133150. It is recommended to upgrade the affected component.

gcc-15.2.0

/nix/store/k9hgkb4k9a0rc182jd42bl3rjm7b5y7g-gcc-15.2.0.drv
CVE                                                CVSSv3   Description
https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-4039     4.8      **DISPUTED**A failure in the -fstack-protector feature in GCC-based toolchains
that target AArch64 allows an attacker to exploit an existing buffer
overflow in dynamically-sized local variables in your application
without this being detected. This stack-protector failure only applies
to C99-style dynamically-sized local variables or those created using
alloca(). The stack-protector operates as intended for statically-sized
local variables.

The default behavior when the stack-protector
detects an overflow is to terminate your application, resulting in
controlled loss of availability. An attacker who can exploit a buffer
overflow without triggering the stack-protector might be able to change
program flow control to cause an uncontrolled loss of availability or to
 go further and affect confidentiality or integrity. NOTE: The GCC project argues that this is a missed hardening bug and not a vulnerability by itself.

glibc-2.40-66

/nix/store/qnkn783cj8hvai99grfcypji0p87g22s-glibc-2.40-66.drv
CVE                                                CVSSv3   Description
https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-5702     5.6      The strcmp implementation optimized for the Power10 processor in the GNU C Library version 2.39 and later writes to vector registers v20 to v31 without saving contents from the caller (those registers are defined as non-volatile registers by the powerpc64le ABI), resulting in overwriting of its contents and potentially altering control flow of the caller, or leaking the input strings to the function to other parts of the program.
https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-5745     5.6      The strncmp implementation optimized for the Power10 processor in the GNU C Library version 2.40 and later writes to vector registers v20 to v31 without saving contents from the caller (those registers are defined as non-volatile registers by the powerpc64le ABI), resulting in overwriting of its contents and potentially altering control flow of the caller, or leaking the input strings to the function to other parts of the program.

zlib-1.3.1

/nix/store/qn5sqhnh8izb0rasxw8vz4m32r6g74gn-zlib-1.3.1.drv
CVE                                                CVSSv3   Description
https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-6992     4.0      Cloudflare version of zlib library was found to be vulnerable to memory corruption issues affecting the deflation algorithm implementation (deflate.c). The issues resulted from improper input validation and heap-based buffer overflow.
A local attacker could exploit the problem during compression using a crafted malicious file potentially leading to denial of service of the software.
Patches: The issue has been patched in commit  8352d10 https://github.com/cloudflare/zlib/commit/8352d108c05db1bdc5ac3bdf834dad641694c13c . The upstream repository is not affected.
